### ModularCarSim
This project went through a large rewrite from the CarSimulation project. The new project utilizes new module features in Java 9.

This project uses JavaFX for the simulation module (which is not part of the JDK since 11) and [simple-logging](https://github.com/GENGCHENLIU/simple-logging).
